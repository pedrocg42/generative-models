# Generative Models

## Introduction

This repository was created with the intention of being the workspace for my experimentation of generative models. My intention is to try to train different models of different kinds to try on my own to see the differences in the training process and the outcome of these models.

The intention to this day is to try to train the following types of generative models:

* Variational Autoencoder
* Generative Adversarial Network
* Transformer
